				<h4>Overview</h4>
				<p>For this project, I worked with three other people to try and
                    restore a kayak from 2012 and make it autonomous. The goal
                    was to create another vehicle for Olin's Climate Robotics and 
                    Expeditonary Science Technology (CREST) research lab to use
                    on the water. The kayak would be the largest vehicle in the fleet,
                    useful for carrying larger payloads, including a CTD (conductivity,
                    temperature, and depth instruments) and a DGEU (Greenhouse gas
                    analyzer), and travel longer in choppier
                    waters.

                <p>As one of my first big projects, I learned a lot about control
                    systems and power distribution. I learned about analog vs 
                    digital signals, how to have sensors communicate with a computer
                    and flight controller, and how to have that all in turn communicate
                    with a ground station. I also learned how important documentation is,
                    especially because we inherited a poorly documented project.
                </p>

                <p>At the end of the semester, we had finished deciding what
                    components we needed, and creating a system diagram 
                    for wires and communication protocols. I also started to set 
                    up our pixhawk with ArduPilot and get familiar with the software.
                    However we ultimately decided not to continue as the kayak 
                    only had a single motor, while would need its own custom airframe.
