				<h4>Overview</h4>
				<p>For this project, I led three classmates through 3 sprints
					spread across 8 weeks to design and build a soil-sensing snake robot.
				</p>
				<p>I worked on the mechanical design, including the u-links, providing the snake
					with 6 degrees of freedom to slither, and designing and manufacturing
					the skin to cover the robot and protect the mechanisms from any dirt
					debris. I also worked on integrating the electronics, which included
					testing the power supply, coding the motors and sensors, along with
					connecting the raspberry pi pico w's to our ground station, a raspberry pi 4,
					through wifi.

				<h4>Learnings</h4>
				<p>Along with learning how to manage people, making sure tasks were done
					on time and correctly, I also learned a lot about ideating and
					iterating mechanical designs quickly.
				</p>
				<p>For the skin, I took inspiration from origami patterns I had
					worked with before to create a flexible skin that
					would stretch and compress along with the snake's movement. Once we
					got a pattern down, we had to figure out how to manufacture it
					using a water proof material. We wanted to stay away from 3d printing,
					as to not release micro plastics into the soil, so we were left with
					two options, leather and cloth. We ended up going with cloth
					even though it took longer to make because
					when we tested leather, it was too stiff to flex properly.
					We got the idea of using cloth from composites. Instead of using epoxy, we
					used elmers glue to stiffen the cloth inside each triangle while leaving
					the edges of each triangle glueless, allowing the cloth to act as a hinge.
					This ultimately gave the cloth flexibility while still being stiff enough
					to keep its shape.
					The images below show the paper iterations, clamping the cloth after the glue
					dried and it was sewn together, and a video of the initial testing rig
					making sure the pattern was flexible enough.

				<p>For the u-links, we started with a simple rectangle design, removing material
					to give it more range of motion. We added mounts for motors and batteries,
					leaving space for wiring to go through. After initial testing, we extended
					the length of the u-links to give it more torque and move farther.
					After looking at other ways to manufacture, we ended up deciding to 3d printing
					the links, as the skin would protect the links from shedding micro plastics
					and because of the shape, this would be hard to make with other manufacturing
					methods. The images below show the initial CAD and final u-joint design.
